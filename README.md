PyTorch implementation of L2L execution algorithm
</div>

## ðŸš€ Features

For your development we've prepared:

- Supports for `Python 3.7` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as the dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/setup.cfg).
- Power of [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) formatters.
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with formatters above.
- Type checks with the configured [`mypy`](https://mypy.readthedocs.io).
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
- Docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint).
- Security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit).
- Well-made [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/.editorconfig), [`.dockerignore`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/.dockerignore), and [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/.gitignore). You don't have to worry about those things.

For building and deployment:

- `GitHub` integration.
- [`Makefile`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/Makefile#L89) for building routines. Everything is already set up for security checks, codestyle checks, code formatting, testing, linting, docker builds, etc. More details at [Makefile summary](#makefile-usage)).
- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) for your package.
- `Github Actions` with predefined [build workflow](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) as the default CI/CD.
- Always up-to-date dependencies with [`@dependabot`](https://dependabot.com/) (You will only [enable it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates#enabling-github-dependabot-version-updates)).
- Automatic drafts of new releases with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). It creates a list of changes based on labels in merged `Pull Requests`. You can see labels (aka `categories`) in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.yml). Works perfectly with [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

For creating your open source community:

- Ready-to-use [Pull Requests templates](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and several [Issue templates](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
- Files such as: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` are generated automatically.
- [`Stale bot`](https://github.com/apps/stale) that closes abandoned issues after a period of inactivity. (You will only [need to setup free plan](https://github.com/marketplace/stale)). Configuration is [here](https://github.com/TezRomacH/layer-to-layer-pytorch/blob/master/.github/.stale.yml).
- [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter).
